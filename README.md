# Knocker

## Next Steps:

- [x] - Add User Authentication Via AWS Cognito
  - Resources: https://itnext.io/my-experience-with-severless-graphql-2e95e5a8bda7
- [ ] - Configure Knocker to user Hosted Web Address
  - [ ] - Purchase knocker.com via Route 53
  - [ ] - Configure the API Gateway to use Route 53 via Serverless
  - [ ] - Update Amplify Configure to use Knocker API Address
    - Resources: https://www.serverless.com/blog/serverless-api-gateway-domain/
- [ ] - Authorization with JWT
  - [ ] - When a User Signs Up With Cognito, Create A Player in DynamoDB Table
    - Resources:

      - https://github.com/vbudilov/cognito-to-dynamodb-lambda
        > I would definitely use DynamoDB for storing additional user meta-data. I created a Lambda function to automatically (using Cognito triggers) copy newly-created Cognito users to a DynamoDB's Users table. That gives you the essential setup to continue adding the meta-data. It comes useful if you want to use AppSync (or anything else for that matter) to retrieve and manipulate the data. It's much more effective to work with DDB for key-value lookups than Cognito since you control the scalability of DDB and you can add a lot of different data types into DDB (vs clear text in Cognito).
  - [ ] - Using Token Passed In Context, be able to retrieve a user
    - Implementation

      ```
        // using apollo-server 2.x
        const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');

        const server = new ApolloServer({
        typeDefs,
        resolvers,
        context: ({ req }) => {
          // Note! This example uses the `req` object to access headers,
          // but the arguments received by `context` vary by integration.
          // This means they will vary for Express, Koa, Lambda, etc.!
          //
          // To find out the correct arguments for a specific integration,
          // see the `context` option in the API reference for `apollo-server`:
          // https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/api/apollo-server/

          // Get the user token from the headers.
          const token = req.headers.authorization || '';

          // try to retrieve a user with the token
          const user = getUser(token);

          // add the user to the context
          return { user };
        },
        });

        server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
        console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`)
        });
      ```

```

## Notes

Looks like Graphql has issues with merging Resolvers, so either the resolvers have to be in the same file, or figure out how they can be merged

## Graphql

Add Player

```
mutation {
  putPlayer(data:{
    username: "tymg",
    name: "Matt Green",
    email: "verde.mateo.a@gmail.com"
  }) {
    error
  }
}
```
